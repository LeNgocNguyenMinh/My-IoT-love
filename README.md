So, this is one my favourites project, the idea come from how to detect the harmful elements in the environment that are invisible to the naked eye. In this project, i set up 2 capacitor (MQ2 and MQ5). Each of them capable to get some information from the environtment, and send it to the database.\
This Setup can detect the CO, amount of fine dust, dirty smoke, temperature and notify the user when the above parameters exceed the threshold.
