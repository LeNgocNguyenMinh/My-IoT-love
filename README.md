So, this is one my favourites project, the idea come from how to detect the harmful elements in the environment that are invisible to the naked eye. In this project, i set up 2 capacitor (MQ2 and MQ5). Each of them capable to get some information from the environtment, and send it to the database. /
This Setup can detect the CO, amount of fine dust, dirty smoke, temperature and notify the user when the above parameters exceed the threshold.
